Singularity integration for CWL

Tested on a vagrant machine set up according to singularity's installation instructions
http://singularity.lbl.gov/install-mac
Some additiona packages were required for this box in order to get basic things running (e.g. pip).
Code for evaluating results were taken from section 2.6 of CWL User Guide
http://www.commonwl.org/v1.0/UserGuide.html#Running_tools_inside_Docker
Evaluated using the typical Â´cwl-runner tool.cwl job.yml`
Passed `make test`.
Some issues running the CWL test spec `https://github.com/common-workflow-language/common-workflow-language.git` due to lack of nodeJS. Rerunning...
